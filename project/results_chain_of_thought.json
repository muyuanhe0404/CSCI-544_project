Since the cougar does not have more money than the husky and the goose combined, the cougar does surrender to the crow as logically established in Rule3.\n\n3. The mannikin is a sales manager. According to Rule2, if the mannikin works in computer science and engineering, it will not leave the houses occupied by the crow.

Considering Rule6, the conditions state that if the cougar surrenders to the crow and the mannikin does not leave the houses occupied by the crow, then you can add crow falls on a square that belongs to the wolf to your conclusions. Since we established that the cougar surrenders to the crow, this rule might indicate that the crow falls on a square of the wolf. However, since we were unable to definitively establish the relationship between the mannikin and the crow, we cannot be entirely certain.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided information and analysis, it seems likely that the crow falls on a square of the wolf, but we cannot definitively confirm it due to the ambiguity regarding the mannikin's profession."},{"question":"A few players are playing a boardgame.

The fish shouts at the bee. The gorilla wants to see the llama. The badger does not create one castle for the liger, and does not swim in the pool next to the house of the fangtooth. The llama does not disarm the monkey. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: For the dove, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the bee unites with the dove and 2) the llama borrows a weapon from the dove, then you can add \"dove invests in the company whose owner is the cobra\" to your conclusions. Rule2: The living creature that disarms the monkey will also borrow a weapon from the dove, without a doubt.

The llama does not disarm the monkey (given information).\n\nConsidering Rule2, which states that the living creature disarming the monkey will also borrow a weapon from the dove, we can deduce that because the llama does not disarm the monkey, it won't borrow a weapon from the dove.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that there is no way for both of the conditions in Rule1 to be met (the bee uniting with the dove and the llama borrowing a weapon from the dove) to fulfill the requirement for the dove to invest in the company owned by the cobra. Since the llama does not borrow a weapon from the dove, the condition in Rule1 cannot be satisfied, and it follows that the dove does not invest in the company owned by the cobra.\n\nTherefore, based on the current information and the rules provided, the statement \"the dove invests in the company whose owner is the cobra\" is not true."},{"question":"A few players are playing a boardgame.

Rule2: Be careful when something pays money to the basenji and also neglects the frog because in this case it will surely not take over the emperor of the reindeer (this may or may not be problematic). Rule3: Regarding the worm, if it has a basketball that fits in a 39.5 x 39.3 x 34.5 inches box, then we can conclude that it does not dance with the elk.

The elk has 67 dollars, which is more than the seal's 36 dollars, so the elk pays money to the basenji per Rule 1.\n3.

The number of friends of the leopard: Rule5 states that if the leopard has fewer than 9 friends, it does not negotiate a deal with the dragonfly.

Therefore, based on Rule1, the dachshund does not build a power plant close to the green fields of the bison.\n\nApplying Rule2: If an animal wants to see the leopard, it will take over the emperor of the cobra.\n\nSince the rhino wants to see the leopard, we can infer that the rhino will take over the emperor of the cobra.\n\nRule3 states that the dachshund hides the cards from the walrus whenever at least one animal dances with the cobra.

The gorilla does not shout at the lizard. The zebra does not destroy the wall constructed by the swallow. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The living creature that borrows one of the weapons of the lizard will also unite with the butterfly, without a doubt. Rule2: Are you certain that one of the animals does not destroy the wall built by the swallow but it does swim in the pool next to the house of the goat? Then you can also be certain that this animal captures the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the butterfly. Rule3: The zebra will not capture the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the butterfly if it (the zebra) has more money than the chinchilla and the walrus combined. Rule4: The butterfly will not acquire a photograph of the lizard if it (the butterfly) is in Africa at the moment. Rule5: In order to conclude that the butterfly destroys the wall constructed by the pelikan, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the zebra should capture the king of the butterfly and secondly the gorilla should unite with the butterfly.

Since the gorilla has a basket and not a sharp object, this rule does not directly impact the possibility of the butterfly destroying the wall constructed by the pelikan.\n\n4. Rule7 states that if something does not want to see the lizard, then it does not destroy the wall built by the pelikan.
