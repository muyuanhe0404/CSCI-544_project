The current state of the game is as follows. The carp rolls the dice for the squirrel. The sea bass sings a victory song for the elephant. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the carp rolls the dice for the squirrel, then the squirrel removes from the board one of the pieces of the sheep. Rule2: If the squirrel removes one of the pieces of the sheep and the zander knocks down the fortress of the sheep, then the sheep removes one of the pieces of the whale. Rule3: Regarding the zander, if it took a bike from the store, then we can conclude that it does not knock down the fortress of the sheep. Rule4: The zander knocks down the fortress of the sheep whenever at least one animal sings a song of victory for the elephant. Rule3 is preferred over Rule4. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the sheep remove from the board one of the pieces of the whale?\n","        The reasoning is:\n","            We know the sea bass sings a victory song for the elephant, and according to Rule4 \"if at least one animal sings a victory song for the elephant, then the zander knocks down the fortress of the sheep\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule3 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the zander took a bike from the store\", so we can conclude \"the zander knocks down the fortress of the sheep\". We know the carp rolls the dice for the squirrel, and according to Rule1 \"if the carp rolls the dice for the squirrel, then the squirrel removes from the board one of the pieces of the sheep\", so we can conclude \"the squirrel removes from the board one of the pieces of the sheep\". We know the squirrel removes from the board one of the pieces of the sheep and the zander knocks down the fortress of the sheep, and according to Rule2 \"if the squirrel removes from the board one of the pieces of the sheep and the zander knocks down the fortress of the sheep, then the sheep removes from the board one of the pieces of the whale\", so we can conclude \"the sheep removes from the board one of the pieces of the whale\".
