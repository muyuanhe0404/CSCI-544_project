Rule4: For the mule, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the frog does not swim in the pool next to the house of the mule and 2) the mannikin hides the cards that she has from the mule, then you can add \"mule creates one castle for the ant\" to your conclusions. Rule5: Here is an important piece of information about the worm: if it is less than two years old then it does not borrow a weapon from the swallow for sure. Rule6: If there is evidence that one animal, no matter which one, borrows a weapon from the swallow, then the mule tears down the castle of the chihuahua undoubtedly.
