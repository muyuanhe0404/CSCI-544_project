The basenji has 84 dollars, is watching a movie from 2007, and does not enjoy the company of the gadwall. The basenji smiles at the owl. The german shepherd trades one of its pieces with the basenji. The reindeer manages to convince the basenji. The seahorse has 44 dollars. The dragonfly does not call the basenji. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The basenji will not want to see the swan if it (the basenji) has more money than the seahorse. Rule2: If something does not enjoy the companionship of the gadwall, then it calls the songbird. Rule3: If the basenji is watching a movie that was released before SpaceX was founded, then the basenji does not want to see the swan. Rule4: Be careful when something does not enjoy the companionship of the cougar but calls the songbird because in this case it will, surely, capture the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the dolphin (this may or may not be problematic). Rule5: For the basenji, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the german shepherd trades one of its pieces with the basenji and 2) the dragonfly does not call the basenji, then you can add that the basenji will never enjoy the company of the cougar to your conclusions. Rule6: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals smiles at the owl, you can be certain that it will also want to see the swan. Rule6 is preferred over Rule1. Rule6 is preferred over Rule3.

The songbird leaves the houses occupied by the camel. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the fangtooth has more money than the bear, then the fangtooth trades one of its pieces with the akita. Rule2: If there is evidence that one animal, no matter which one, trades one of the pieces in its possession with the akita, then the swan is not going to smile at the german shepherd.

Rule4: The dragon will not invest in the company whose owner is the swan if it (the dragon) is in South America at the moment.

The mule creates one castle for the dragon. The mule has a banana-strawberry smoothie, is watching a movie from 1994, and wants to see the stork. The snake destroys the wall constructed by the frog. The frog does not destroy the wall constructed by the goat. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If something leaves the houses occupied by the shark, then it does not suspect the truthfulness of the worm. Rule2: Regarding the mule, if it is watching a movie that was released before the Berlin wall fell, then we can conclude that it takes over the emperor of the monkey. Rule3: The monkey will leave the houses occupied by the shark if it (the monkey) works in healthcare. Rule4: If the mule has something to drink, then the mule takes over the emperor of the monkey. Rule5: Regarding the monkey, if it has a notebook that fits in a 12.1 x 17.8 inches box, then we can conclude that it leaves the houses occupied by the shark. Rule6: In order to conclude that the monkey suspects the truthfulness of the worm, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the mule should take over the emperor of the monkey and secondly the frog should call the monkey. Rule7: The living creature that does not destroy the wall constructed by the goat will call the monkey with no doubts. Rule6 is preferred over Rule1.

Rule1: The finch does not tear down the castle of the dugong whenever at least one animal negotiates a deal with the cobra. Rule2: If the finch has more than six friends, then the finch tears down the castle of the dugong. Rule3: If at least one animal refuses to help the camel, then the ostrich captures the king of the finch. Rule4: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals swims in the pool next to the house of the seal, you can be certain that it will not destroy the wall constructed by the finch. Rule5: Here is an important piece of information about the finch: if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the lizard's name then it tears down the castle that belongs to the dugong for sure. Rule6: One of the rules of the game is that if the bear does not destroy the wall built by the dinosaur, then the dinosaur will, without hesitation, destroy the wall constructed by the finch. Rule7: From observing that one animal reveals a secret to the dolphin, one can conclude that it also borrows a weapon from the snake, undoubtedly. Rule8: Be careful when something borrows a weapon from the snake and also tears down the castle that belongs to the dugong because in this case it will surely dance with the crab (this may or may not be problematic). Rule9: If the reindeer unites with the ostrich, then the ostrich is not going to capture the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the finch. Rule1 is preferred over Rule2. Rule1 is preferred over Rule5. Rule6 is preferred over Rule4. Rule9 is preferred over Rule3. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the finch dance with the crab?",
    "proof": "We know the finch has 3 friends that are adventurous and 6 friends that are not, so the finch has 9 friends in total which is more than 6, and according to Rule2 \"if the finch has more than six friends, then the finch tears down the castle that belongs to the dugong\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule1 we cannot prove the antecedent \"at least one animal negotiates a deal with the cobra\", so we can conclude \"the finch tears down the castle that belongs to the dugong\".

    "example": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The cobra is named Luna. The mannikin has 12 dollars. The ostrich has 52 dollars, is named Meadow, and is watching a movie from 1958. The ostrich has a football with a radius of 17 inches. The stork invests in the company whose owner is the crab. The bison does not fall on a square of the dugong. The owl does not fall on a square of the bison. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If something does not fall on a square of the dugong, then it unites with the mule. Rule2: This is a basic rule: if the owl does not fall on a square of the bison, then the conclusion that the bison will not create a castle for the chihuahua follows immediately and effectively. Rule3: There exists an animal which invests in the company owned by the crab? Then, the cougar definitely does not hide the cards that she has from the bison. Rule4: If the ostrich has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the cobra's name, then the ostrich swears to the bison. Rule5: If the ostrich has more money than the peafowl and the mannikin combined, then the ostrich does not swear to the bison. Rule6: If the ostrich is watching a movie that was released after Richard Nixon resigned, then the ostrich does not swear to the bison. Rule7: For the bison, if the belief is that the cougar is not going to hide the cards that she has from the bison but the ostrich swears to the bison, then you can add that \"the bison is not going to unite with the shark\" to your conclusions. Rule8: If the ostrich has a football that fits in a 38.8 x 38.3 x 38.7 inches box, then the ostrich swears to the bison. Rule5 is preferred over Rule4. Rule5 is preferred over Rule8. Rule6 is preferred over Rule4. Rule6 is preferred over Rule8. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the bison unite with the shark?",
    "proof": "We know the ostrich has a football with a radius of 17 inches, the diameter=2*radius=34.0 so the ball fits in a 38.8 x 38.3 x 38.7 box because the diameter is smaller than all dimensions of the box, and according to Rule8 \"if the ostrich has a football that fits in a 38.8 x 38.3 x 38.7 inches box, then the ostrich swears to the bison\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule5 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the ostrich has more money than the peafowl and the mannikin combined\" and for Rule6 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the ostrich is watching a movie that was released after Richard Nixon resigned\", so we can conclude \"the ostrich swears to the bison\". We know the stork invests in the company whose owner is the crab, and according to Rule3 \"if at least one animal invests in the company whose owner is the crab, then the cougar does not hide the cards that she has from the bison\", so we can conclude \"the cougar does not hide the cards that she has from the bison\". We know the cougar does not hide the cards that she has from the bison and the ostrich swears to the bison, and according to Rule7 \"if the cougar does not hide the cards that she has from the bison but the ostrich swears to the bison, then the bison does not unite with the shark\", so we can conclude \"the bison does not unite with the shark\".
