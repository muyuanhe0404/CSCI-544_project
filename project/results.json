Rule1: For the pelikan, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) that mouse does not swim inside the pool located besides the house of the pelikan and 2) that crab brings an oil tank for the pelikan, then you can add pelikan will never disarm the bear to your conclusions. Rule2: One of the rules of the game is that if the butterfly hides her cards from the pelikan, then the pelikan will, without hesitation, neglect the pigeon. Rule3: The living creature that disarms the dachshund will never bring an oil tank for the pelikan. Rule4: Be careful when something hides her cards from the elk and also neglects the pigeon because in this case it will surely disarm the bear (this may or may not be problematic). Rule5: The mouse will swim inside the pool located besides the house of the pelikan if it (the mouse) is in Germany at the moment.
